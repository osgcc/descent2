Message from Matt Toschlog & Mike Kulas:

Descent fans:

Here, finally, is the source for Descent II.  We've been so busy with 
Descent 3, Mercenary, FreeSpace, FreeSpace 2, and several other 
projects that we haven't given much thought to this old code.  But we 
know that many of you are eager to get it, so here you go.

We were amazed and impressed at the cool things people did with 
the Descent source we released a few years ago.  It touches us 
deeply how devoted some people are to the Descent series, and we 
look forward to seeing what people can do with this Descent II 
source.

About the Source Code:

Included is almost all the source code to Descent 2, ver. 1.2.  We removed
all code to which we did not own the copyright.  This mainly involved low-
level sound and modem code and the movie code.    

The Descent Network has agreed to provide a list of mirror locations where 
this code can be downloaded. The location is:

http://www.descent2.com/ddn/sources/descent2

The following tools were used in the development of Descent:
Watcom C/C++, version 9.5
Microsoft Macro Assembler, version 6.1x
Opus Make, version 6.01

Have fun with the code!

As Packaged the code currently will not compile. Some code had to be removed
to release it, therefore you will get some missing file errors when building.

Much of this code is very close to the Descent 1 source code. Many people have
put effort into porting that code, so if you are interested in porting D2, you
should be able to take advantage of some of that work.
