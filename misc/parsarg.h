	Routine to parse the command line. Will also read and parse args 
	from a file.

	parse_args() is called with argc & argv from main(), the function
	to be called with each argument, and flags.  argc & argv are usually 
	adjusted to not pass the first parameter (the program file name).  
	Thus the general method of calling is:

		parse_args(argc-1,argv+1,hander_func,flags);

	handler_func() is then called with each parameter.

	If the PA_EXPAND flag is passed, all arguments which do not start
	with '-' are assumed to be filenames and are expanded for wildcards,
	with the handler function called for each match.  If a spec matches
	nothing, the spec itself is passed to the handler func.
 
	Args that start with '@' are assumed to be argument files.  These
	files are opened, and arguments are read from them just as if they
	were specified on the command line.  Arg files can be nested.
