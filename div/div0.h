// These are constants passed for the default mode.  If the address of the div
// instruction is not in the Callback (CB) list and also not in the
// Saturate (SAT) list, then the default mode will be used. It will either
// do an int 3 and then dump the registers and break to DOS (DM_ERROR)
// or else it will saturate the result and allow the program to continue
// if DM_SATURATE is specified.

// All registers, etc should be exactly as before the DIV instruction. This
// doesn't work within C. This returns 1 if ok, and 0 if there isn't any more
// "slots" available.  The number of slots can be changed in div0.asm by
// changing the MAX_SIZE constant.  MAX_SIZE = 100 now.

// EAX = *div_addr, EDX=*handler_addr, Return value in EAX.

// has been used.

//     has occurred and was corrected by calling a user-specified function.
//   - div0_num_handled_by_satlist is the number of times a divide exception
//     has occured and the result was saturated because it specifically was
//     in the saturation list.
//   - div0_num_saturated are the divides that aren't handled by the programmer
//     explicitly, but the handler went ahead and sautrated anyway.  These
//     probably shouldn't be happening very often.
